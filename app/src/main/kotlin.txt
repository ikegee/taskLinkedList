In Kotlin programming language, the symbols `?` and `!!` are used to handle nullability.

The `?` symbol is used to declare a nullable variable. A nullable variable can hold a value or be
null. For example, `var name: String? = null` declares a nullable variable `name` of type `String`.

The `!!` symbol is called the **not-null assertion operator**. It is used to assert that a variable
 is not null. If the variable is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown at runtime. For example,
 `val nameLength = name!!.length` asserts that `name` is not null and returns the length of the
 string.

It is important to use these symbols carefully to avoid runtime errors. The `?` symbol is used to
handle nullability in a safe way, while the `!!` symbol should be used only when you are sure that
the variable is not null.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
